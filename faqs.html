              <p>Not at all! SAI is for anyone who loves music and has been involved in at least one music class at Truman.
                We have several music majors in our chapter, but we also have several members who are non-majors. For example, 
                the really cool person who made this website is a computer science major who also loves to sing!

              <p>You will pay an initial fee of $50 when you turn in your bid. Then, when you take your national exam,
                you will pay a fee of $250, but your fundraiser will cover part of this fee. 
                Members pay $60 per semester in dues, which includes $40 in national dues and $20 in chapter dues.
