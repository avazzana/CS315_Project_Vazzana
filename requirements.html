        <h1>Time commitments of active members</h1>
            <p>Each member is required to attend a chapter meeting every Thursday night at 7pm. Chapter meetings can last up to an hour an a half,
            but most are shorter! Additionally, each member must serve on at least one committee. Most committees meet once per week and have meetings
            that last around half an hour. In addition, we have a few other requirements throughout the year:
