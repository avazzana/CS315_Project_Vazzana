            <p>After you turn in your bid and attend the initial event, you will become an SAI Member-in-Training, or MIT. Your

                <div class = "column">
                    At some point in your MIT season, you will be given a big. She will serve as a guide and is there to help you with anything you might need during your MIT process.

                <h2>Weekly class meetings</h2>
                Each week, you'll meet with your MIT class and VPM. Your VPM will help you learn about Sigma Alpha Iota to prepare for the national exam. She'll also help your MIT class get started with planning your events.

                <h2>Attend chapter meetings</h2>
                You'll have the opportunity to attend a few chapter meetings during your MIT season. 
                Attending these meetings is a great way to connect with some of the current active members and get a preview of what chapter meetings are like!

                    During your MIT season, you'll have a lot of papers to keep track of, including music, worksheets, and notes, so having a place to keep it all is important.
                Our chapter has a tradition where our MITs get together with their constellations and make a binder. Grab a hot glue gun and some fabric and get creative!

                <h2>National Exam</h2>
                Before you can join SAI, you need to pass a national exam to show what you've learned about Sigma Alpha Iota. Don't stress out too much, you can take it multiple times. 
                The author of this website is TERRIBLE at taking exams and she passed it, so you have nothing to worry about.
